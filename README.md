Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the current state-of-art architecture for image classification task. 
Whether it is facial recognition, self driving cars or object  detection, CNNs  are  being  used  everywhere. 
While MNIST database  (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database
of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing  systems. The  database is
also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

A CNN consists of an input and an output layer, as well as  multiple  hidden  layers. The  hidden  layers of a 
CNN typically consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers and normalization layers
Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between  neurons 
resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. 

### Thus this project tries to implement the input, output as well as various hidden layers of CNN.
